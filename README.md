**Farmart** is a modern e-commerce platform that empowers farmers to sell livestock directly to buyers — eliminating costly middlemen and restoring transparency to agricultural trade.

## About Farmart

Farmers and distributors have long conducted business on trust and relationships. Yet, despite this strong foundation, they often find themselves dependent on middlemen who absorb a disproportionate share of profits through inefficient and sometimes exploitative practices.

**Farmart was created to change that.**

We believe that the people who raise livestock should be the ones who benefit most from their hard work. Farmart bridges the gap between farmers and buyers by providing a digital marketplace where transactions are direct, secure, and fair — removing unnecessary intermediaries from the process.
